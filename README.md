# SQLPetProject
Hands-on project using PostgreSQL(ver.16) DBMS (Database Management System) and pgAdmin 4 GUI 

## Database creation
Right-click on pg Admin Databases option and choose "Create"

## To insert data from source file
Right click on Schemas and choose Query Tool. Then open your file and execute it - press "play button" 

## SELECT
Remember about comma between column names (last argument without it!)
<b>SELECT 
column1,...
FROM 
table name</b>

### SELECT DISTINCT
Get first occurence only. 
<b>Distinct in terms of all selected columns!</b>

## ORDER BY
You can use a number of column instead of it's name(not a best practice)
DESC - descending
ASC - ascending (default)
